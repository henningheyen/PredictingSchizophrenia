# PredictingSchizophrenia
The objective of this project is to utilize grey matter measurements obtained from structural MRI brain scans to create a predictor that can differentiate between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. I am comparing three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forrest and MultiLayerPerceptron. This project is part of a RAMP challenge.
