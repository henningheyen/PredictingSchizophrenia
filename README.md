# PredictingSchizophrenia
The objective of this project is to utilize grey matter measurements obtained from structural MRI brain scans to create a predictor that can differentiate between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. This project is part of a RAMP challenge. 

I am comparing three models: 
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forrest
- MultiLayerPerceptron

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a Report.
